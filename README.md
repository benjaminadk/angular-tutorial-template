# Simple Angular CLI Config
### Setup for Cloud 9 and Udemy Tutorial Series - Angular 4
- `npm start` command, `ng serve`,  is tailored with specific host, port and 
public flags that allow the development server to run on Cloud 9
- `FormsModule` has been imported to allow `ngModule` command 
- `Bootstrap` has been installed with `bootstrap.min.css` imported into the 
styles array in `.angular-cli.json` configuration file
- Otherwise, setup is stock
- This allows for rapid creation of projects that will run on Cloud 9 easily, 
as well as use the default styling and tooling of the Udemy Tutorial
